# Reports
 
Reports is a web app designed for teachers, to help produce meaningful written reports in a fraction of the time it would normally take to do so. It analyses data input by the user with known other data (such as grade scales) to automatically generate a unique comment which will help the learner improve.

Reports has a few important goals:

- It should be **quick** and **easy** for the user to generate a unique report.
- It should be easy to navigate, with clear language and instructions for novice tech users.
- It should import data easily from a variety of different platforms (such as powerschool, GoForSchools etc)

Currently the first goal only I feel is being met, to meet the next few goals:

- Whilst it is easy to navigate (I think!) there needs to be more instruction on how to use, and so  a tutorials module will be build which can float on top of the rest of the APP.
- Importing data is a little tricky. Copy and paste is supported well because of the easy with which you can modify groups, but its hard to test because I only have access to powerschool currently.
