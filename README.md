# ReportZone (<a href="https://reportszone.sweeto.co.uk">Live Site</a>!)

This website was designed as a solution to report writing in education. Many teachers struggle 2 to 4 times a year to write reports for hundreds of students. Mostly these reports are a reflection of how they have worked in class, their achievement and any improvements they can make for future success. ReportsZone takes a limited data set and produces full reports ready to be sent home to parents.

## Tech

ReportsZone was made in Angular2. The backend is supplied by Firebase, including authentication and databasing. Payment is currently disabled but integrated via PayPal.

## Future Plans

This site is still a work in progress, but due to report cycles goes through two iteratrions per year. My current todo list is:

- [ ] See how it might be easier to add students.
- [ ] Create student self data collection integration.
